# My-Quiz-app
This is my first app I made as coding practice with simple vanilla html, css and java script. It asks a random question out of three preset ones and provides three preset answers to each question. The app looks at your answer and tells you whether you were correct or not. It also has a restart button after answering so you can play again.

As a coding practice exercise I thought this was a decent practical introduction to basic syntax and basic features of css and html. You also learn how the files of the program interact with each other, html being the skeleton from which other files are being referenced. Javascript definitely felt the most complicated out of the three and most of my time spent thinking was there. Currently I feel that javascript has a lot of depth to it and plenty of stuff I have no idea about.
