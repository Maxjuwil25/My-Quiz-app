# My-Quiz-app
This is my first app I made as coding practice with simple vanilla html, css and java script. It asks a random question out of three preset ones and provides three preset answers to each question. The app looks at your answer and tells you whether you were correct or not. It also has a restart button after answering so you can play again.
